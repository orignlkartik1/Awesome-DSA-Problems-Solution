# Awesome-DSA-Problems-Solutions

A **centralized repository** containing **well-structured and solved DSA problems** from multiple competitive programming platforms.  
This repository is created to **help students understand problem-solving approaches**, improve logic, and prepare for **coding interviews & contests**.

---
# Key Idea 

This is a attempt to create all in one DSA platforms problems solutions and approaches on one repository, which helps students to understand diifrent approaches and mindset (Intuition) behind the problem solving.

---

## What This Repository Offers

- ✅ Solved **Data Structures & Algorithms** problems  
- 🧠 Clear and optimized solutions  
- 📚 Covers beginner to advanced level questions  
- 💻 Written with a focus on **learning and understanding**, not just answers  
- 🏆 Useful for **interview preparation**, **competitive programming**, and **DSA practice**

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are **welcome and appreciated**! 🎉  
This repository is built for learning and growing together, and your contributions can make it even better.

You can contribute by:
- ✨ Adding **new DSA problem solutions**
- 🛠 Improving **existing solutions** (better time/space complexity)
- 🧠 Adding **clear explanations / intuition** behind solutions
- 🐛 Fixing bugs or incorrect logic
- 📁 Organizing folders or improving documentation

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork** this repository  
2. Create a new **branch** for your contribution  
3. Add your solution in the **appropriate platform folder**
4. Follow the existing **code structure and naming conventions**
5. Write **clean, readable, and well-commented code**
6. Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** with a brief description of your changes

### Contribution Rules

- Each solution should be **well-structured and easy to understand**
- Avoid plagiarism — write solutions in **your own words and logic**
- Prefer adding a **brief explanation or intuition** (if possible)
- Ensure the code **compiles and runs correctly**
- Also, file should be in markdown language.

> Even small contributions matter — fixing a typo, optimizing code, or improving explanations helps others learn better ❤️
